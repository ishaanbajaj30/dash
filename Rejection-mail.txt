Respected  Sir
I thank you for the time and effort which your esteemed organisation has put into the recruitment process, and appreciate the interest you have shown in me. But, due to some unfortunate circumstances, I will not be able to take any further part in your recruitment process, because of a certain policy in my university. I would like to formally withdraw my application for the position of summer intern, and I extend my apologies for any inconveniences caused.
Regards
Ishaan Bajaj
